        '''the variables nextt is used to handle touch event in cases when the crow pecks within the circle. It is used so that 
        even when the touch is within the circle when the circle has disappeared, the touch is ignored and the program doesn't hang.
        It is also used as a time sometimes to make sure the time interval is maintained.
        
        nextt='start' initailly(by __init__), it becomes 'o' when the program starts( by update function), 
        nextt != 'o' for 5 s ( or 't' seconds) after which the crow pecks within the shape. In this time nextt will become a datetime.datetime object and indicates the time(absolute time at which screen should reappear).


        the variables blank, cleartime and num_trials are used to ensure that if the crow doesn't peck within the circle in the 30s,
        the trial ends and blank screen appears for 5s.
        blank = True for 5 s (or whatever will the time be set) after a 30s trial is over. All the other times it is False. It is a boolean.



        cleartime is initially set by update function. It is resetted in two casees , if the crow succesfully touches or if 30 s ends.
        s

        blank also helps in ensuring that the touches received during 5s blank screen is ignored.

        prgrm_start_time acts as a refernce also for excel sheet.

        note that blank and nextt are independent variables and are infact for different purposes.

        Only a touch received when next=='o' and blank == False will be checked for if it is within or outside the shape, because (if nextt != 'o' it means it is not even 5s after the last correct touch) or (if blank = True it means it is not even 5s after the last 30s trial ended)
